👩‍💻 For Designers & Developers

All design updates happen directly in Figma, making it easy for designers to showcase screens and for developers to understand layouts, components, and user journeys—keeping design and development perfectly aligned. 🌉

If you want, I can rewrite this in a more technical, portfolio-friendly, or GitHub README tone.
